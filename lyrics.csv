Truth drops like bass lines,Hip-Hop
Iron hearts never die,Metal
Blades clash in the shadows,Metal
Barn dance under the stars,Country
"Darkness falls, we rise again",Metal
Truth drops like bass lines,Hip-Hop
You're the rhythm of my heart,Pop
Trucks and tales on dusty roads,Country
"Hustle hard, never fade",Hip-Hop
Screams echo in the void,Metal
"Burning wheels, speeding dreams",Rock
"Hustle hard, never fade",Hip-Hop
Whiskey nights and campfire sounds,Country
Rebel soul on fire,Rock
"Raise your voice, break the chains",Rock
Counting stacks with style and grace,Hip-Hop
Home's where my heart will stay,Country
I see the stars in your eyes,Pop
Whiskey nights and campfire sounds,Country
Truth drops like bass lines,Hip-Hop
